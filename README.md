<h2>Overview of the analysis</h2>
I was tapped by Pewlett Hackard (PH) to analyize a data trend in their company deemed "The Silver Tsunami". They are witnessing a wave of retirements and are looking to get tabular data on the retirement pool and if any retiree is eligible to mentor the new wave of employees. By creating a frame work of the data network, I was able to clean the data into two deliverables </br>

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

**Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title**
OF the 300,024 current employees at PH, we have found that 30,938 employees are looking to retire; being born the eligible retiring birth date range of Jan 1st, 1952 and Dec 31st 1955. That's 30% of their workforce. This is further broken down in the unique_titles.csv with a list of the retirees, their employee number and the position they held.

We can see how

Of the 300,024 employees working for Pewlett-Hackard it was discovered that 90,398 were born between 1952 and 1955. That is 30.13% of the total workforce at pewlett-hackard. This data is broken down into number of employees retiring and their title. The csv file that shows this data is title_totals.csv. In addition to discovering the number of employees that will be eligible to retire we also discovered the number of employees that can replace them by entering a mentorship program.
