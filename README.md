<h2>Overview of the analysis</h2>
I was tapped by Pewlett Hackard to analyize a data trend in their company deemed "The Silver Tsunami". They are witnessing a wave of retirements and are looking to get tabular data on the retirement pool and if any retiree is eligible to mentor the new wave of employees. By creating a schema of needed categoties

<h2>Results</h2>
**There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)**
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

**Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title**
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions—you’ll need to use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Then, use the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.
