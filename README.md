<h1>Overview of the analysis</h1>
I was tapped by Pewlett Hackard (PH) to analyize a trend in their company they have deemed "The Silver Tsunami". They are witnessing a wave of retirements this year  and stakeholders want to see tabular data on the retirement pool and if any retiree is eligible to mentor the new wave of employees. By creating an ERD of the available data, I was able to group and clean the data into two deliverables. <br/>

<h1>Results</h1>

<h3>Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title</h3>

Of the 300,024 current employees at PH, the company is looking at 90,398 employees that are going to retire this year. That's 30.13% of their workforce that fell in between the retiring birth date range of January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955. This is further broken down in the unique_titles.csv with a list of the retirees, their employee number and the positions they held within the company. Also, the next visual illustrates the number of roles that the the Silver Tsunami will leave behind.

<h3>Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program</h3>
In addition to discovering the number of employees that will be eligible to retire, we also discovered a number of retirees that can entered into a mentorship program for the upcoming wave of recruits.

<h1>Summary</h1>
With 30% of its workforce going into retirement, PH needs to rapidly begin hiring new employees and/or restructuring their workforce in aide to transition and run the future of their company. This mentorship program can help departments streamline transitions, help new employees get up to speed with their new roles. However, these numbers only highlight a small and broad conclusion. We can gain more insights if we decide to look at different factors. With salaries transitioning into retiring funds, we should consider possible freed funds that we can use to hire new positions, galvanize present employees with bonuses or raises or even promote them to more advanced positions.
