<h1>Overview of the analysis</h1>
I was tapped by Pewlett Hackard (PH) to analyize a trend in their company they have deemed "The Silver Tsunami". They are witnessing a wave of retirements this year  and stakeholders want to see tabular data on the retirement pool and if any retiree is eligible to mentor the new wave of employees. By creating an ERD of the available data, I was able to group and clean the data into two deliverables.

<h1>Results</h1>

<h3>Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title</h3>
Of the 300,024 current employees at PH, the company is looking at 90,398 employees that are going to retire this year. That's 30.13% of their workforce that fell in between the retiring birth date range of January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955. This is further broken down in the unique_titles.csv with a list of the retirees, their employee number and the positions they held within the company. Also, the next visual illustrates the number of roles that the the Silver Tsunami will leave behind.

<h3>Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program</h3>
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

 In addition to discovering the number of employees that will be eligible to retire we also discovered the number of employees that can replace them by entering a mentorship program.

- There aren't that many Manager roles retiring and are montly seeing engineer and staff positions.ho
